# snepk
A simple implementation of the snake game in C, for Windows.


## Why?
Long overdue for me, it feels like writing an implementation of Snake is something everyone who's into C should ever try to do, so here's mine.

While there is no shortage of examples for how to write Snake in C on the internet, I just wanted to share my take on it, properly commented and whatnot.
